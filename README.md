> "Quality is not an act, it is a habit." â€” Aristole

Most people would say that regularly testing your code and documenting it are good habits to get into. C++ has a certain level of friction though that makes it hard to get into that habit when compared to other languages which provide first-class support for testing and documentation. The truth is that it takes effort to set up a testing framework like Google Test and a documentation generator like Doxygen for *every* small project you make so it's often tempting to just ignore these and start coding away.

This is where **Streamline** comes in: create new C++ projects with a [solid codebase layout](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork), testing, and documentation generation in a matter of seconds. Streamline generates scripts for building, testing, and documentation when it creates a new project so you're not locked into Streamline and anyone can approach your project like a regular CMake project.

# Run locally

Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/). You will need a version >= 3.24.

Install Python.

Install Doxygen. This is only necessary if you want to generate documentation.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toggysmith/streamline
```

Go to the project directory:

```bash
cd streamline
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

Place `streamline.py` wherever you would like to keep it. You can use it without putting it in your path.

Alternatively, with zshrc you could create a PATH alias by adding the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```
alias streamline='python [location]/streamline.py'
```

where `[location]` is the directory where you placed `streamline.py`.

# Usage examples

## Creating new projects

**To create a new project with the same name as the parent directory:**

```bash
streamline init
```

**To create a new project with a specific name:**

```bash
streamline init --name hello-world
```

**To create a new project that uses a specific C++ version (the default is 17):**

```bash
streamline init --edition 14
```

**To create a new project with unit testing via Google Test:**

```bash
streamline init --tests gtest
```

**To create a new project with documentation generation via Doxygen:**

```bash
streamline init --docs doxygen
```

## Building a project

**To build a project in debug mode implicitly:**

```bash
streamline build
```

**To build a project in debug mode explicitly:**

```bash
streamline build --debug
```

**To build a project in release mode:**

```bash
streamline build --release
```

## Running a project

**To run a project (creates a debug build):**

```bash
streamline run
```

## Generating documentation and running tests

**To run tests (provided a testing framework was set up and tests exist):**

```bash
streamline test
```

**To generate HTML documentation (provided a documentation generator was set up):**

```bash
streamline docs
```

**To generate and open HTML documentation in the default browser:**

```bash
streamline docs --open
```

# Motivation

**Streamline** was designed to streamline setting up the following three things:

# Technical Details

Streamline is built using Python and [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com) which is a wonderful little Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces.
